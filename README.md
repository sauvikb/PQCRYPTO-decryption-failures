Fork of specific subprojects in https://github.com/KULeuven-COSIC/PQCRYPTO-decryption-failures, ``PQCRYPTO-decryption-failures'', scripts relating to decryption failures in PQCRYPTO schemes.

#### DecryptionFailureAttack
Extension of the initial work in https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/1089 that investigated the impact of decryption failures on (Ring/Mod)-LWE/LWR based schemes, 
showing that fixing the composition of secret-keys in schemes makes them more resistant to active attacks exploiting decryption failures.

Investigation into the effect of dependencies on Ring/Mod-LWE/LWR based schemes
